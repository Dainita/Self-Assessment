# Individual Self-Assessment

##
For this project, I contributed to the database and the connection to the final machine learning notebook. Participation in each team discussion via Slack, Zoom, or e-mail was important in keeping the project on track. My greatest challenge over the course of the project was trying to not take over and do everything myself. I am more of an independent worker and prefer to do things from start to finish, then merge with others as necessary. My teammates did an awesome job on this project which gave me complete confidence in them. That trust helped me to overcome this challenge.

## Team-Assessment
The team chose a dataset quickly and was successful at getting an early start on the project deliverables. We communicated often using slack, email and github. There really weren't any communication challenges. Minor challenges occured with database and code but we worked through the issues together and helped each other as needed. One team member traveled to India during the project and had to manage the time zone difference. While this did not cause any issues, it could have and deserves mention of that team member's dedication to the success of the team project.   

## Project Summary
Our analysis used the KNN moded to determine chocolate bar ratings based on cocoa percentage, bean origin, company location, and ingredients. We discovered that cocoa percentage has the greatest impact on the rating at almost 12%. Chocolate maker also has a strong influence on the rating with the top thre producers being Soma, Ritual, and Potomac. A tableau dashboard was developed with heatmaps to show bean origins by ratings and company locations by origin, some bar charts to show top bean origins and top company locations, and a word cloud for the top tastes associated with the top rated chocolate bars.
